# B-Wallet: Ontology DID-Powered Non-Custodial Web3 Wallet

**Empowering Users with Seamless, Private, and Secure Web3 Access**

## Introduction
Web3 promises decentralization, but users still wrestle with clunky authentication, privacy risks, and fragmented asset management. B-Wallet is a non-custodial, DID-powered wallet built on Ontology, simplifying logins, ensuring user control over data and assets, and bridging multiple blockchainsâ€”all in one sleek Chrome extension (with mobile plans ahead).

## What Weâ€™re Building
A browser extension wallet that:
- âœ… **Non-Custodial**: Users own their private keys and mnemonic phrasesâ€”no third-party trust required.
- âœ… **Ontology DID Authentication**: Password-free logins via decentralized identity, with customizable data-sharing (e.g., email, address).
- âœ… **Multi-Chain Support**: ONT, ONG, And all Ontology Native tokens, ETH, BNB, USDT, ADA at launch, with portfolio views and NFT storage.
- âœ… **Testnet Playground**: Toggle between mainnet and testnets (e.g., Ontology Polaris, Ethereum Goerli) with built-in faucets.
- âœ… **Swaps & Bridges**: In-wallet token swaps (via DEX aggregators) and cross-chain bridging (e.g., Wormhole).
- âœ… **Secure Syncing**: Encrypted multi-device preferences via IPFS/Arweave.

## Why It Matters
- ðŸ”¹ **Privacy-First**: Users control what data they shareâ€”no more blind permissions.
- ðŸ”¹ **Frictionless UX**: Smart logins and gas management for a smooth Web3 experience.
- ðŸ”¹ **Developer-Friendly**: Testnet tools and an SDK for dApp builders.
- ðŸ”¹ **Future-Proof**: Multi-chain, NFT-ready, and cross-DID compatible (e.g., W3C DID).

## Who Itâ€™s For
- ðŸš€ Web3 Users seeking self-sovereignty.
- ðŸš€ Developers building dApps with secure onboarding.
- ðŸš€ DeFi/NFT creators needing a versatile wallet.

## Current Progress
- **MVP (Phase 1)**:
  - Chrome extension shell built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS.
  - Ontology DID login implemented (`ontology-ts-sdk`).
  - Mnemonic phrase generation and encrypted storage (`crypto-js`, Chrome `storage.local`).
  - Basic UI with dashboard and testnet/mainnet toggle (functional soon).
- **Next Up**: ONT balance fetching, testnet toggle logic, and user-entered encryption keys.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, TailwindCSS.
- **Web3**: `ontology-ts-sdk`, `ethers.js` (planned), `cardano-serialization-lib` (planned).
- **Contracts**: Rust (Ontology WASM), Solidity (Ethereum/BNB).
- **Storage**: AES encryption, IPFS/Arweave (future).

## Roadmap
1. **Phase 1: DID MVP** (In Progress) - DID login, ONT support, testnet toggle.
2. **Phase 2: Multi-Chain** - ETH, BNB, USDT, ADA, MFA security.
3. **Phase 3: Swaps & NFTs** - Token swaps, cross-chain bridges, NFT display.
4. **Phase 4: Mobile & Ecosystem** - Mobile app, dApp SDK, governance token.

## Monetization
B-Wallet will sustain development via:
- **Freemium**: Free core features, premium upgrades ($5/year).
- **Swap Fees**: 0.2% on in-wallet trades.
- **Partnerships**: Licensing to dApps and businesses.
- **Donations**: Support us at `0xYourEthAddress` (ONT donations welcome too!).

## Funding Needs
To accelerate B-Walletâ€™s development and deliver a polished product, weâ€™re seeking:
- **Funding**: Cover Chrome Web Store fee, dev tools (e.g., IDE subscriptions), and initial testnet funding (e.g., server costs for custom nodes).
- **Collaborators**: Web3 devs (Solidity, Rust), UI/UX designers, or testers.
- **How to Contribute**: Open an issue, submit a PR, or contact me at [barnazaka@gmail.com.com / @yBTZ_0x Xhandle].

## Vision
B-Wallet isnâ€™t just a walletâ€”itâ€™s a gateway to a self-sovereign Web3, rooted in Ontologyâ€™s powerful DID framework. Join us to redefine how users and developers interact with the decentralized web!
